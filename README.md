uzful-scripts
=============

A collection of my daily-use scripts in Linux (bash)

einai.sh -- Checkes if app is installed (eg einai firefox)

cvmake.sh -- Creates CMakeLists.txt and compiles the opencv *.cpp source file.
	     eg. cvmake filename.cpp
	 
youtuber.sh -- Downloads music from youtube into mp3. Just type the artist and song you want.
